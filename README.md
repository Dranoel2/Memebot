# Memebot
The source code for my best (and only) ever discord bot. It uses [memegen.link](https://memegen.link)'s api.

Memebot lets you create memes for you and your friends to enjoy. Creating a meme is as simple as using a single slash command. You can either choose from a list of templates (found by running `/list`) or use a custom image url for your background.
